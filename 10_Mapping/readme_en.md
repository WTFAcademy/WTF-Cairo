# WTF Cairo: 10. Mapping and other types

We are learning `Cairo`, and writing `WTF Cairo Tutorials` for Starknet newbies. The tutorials are based on `Cairo 2.2.0`.

In this chapter, we introduce `mapping` and other useful types in Cairo.

## Mapping in Cairo

The `mapping` type enables users to query a corresponding `Value` using a `Key`. For instance, you can query the balance of an account by its address. In Cairo, the `LegacyMap` is used to create `mapping`.

In the example below, we create a mapping in storage variables called `balances`. This mapping stores the balances (values of type `u256`) for corresponding addresses (keys of type `ContractAddress`).

```rust
// balances storage variable: map from account address to u256
#[storage]
struct Storage {
    balances: Map::<ContractAddress, u256>,
}
```

You can query the balance of a given address. Note that Cairo does not natively support an `address` type like Solidity. Instead, you need to import it with `use starknet::ContractAddress;`.

```rust
// read balance
#[external(v0)]
fn read_balance(self: @ContractState, account: ContractAddress) -> u256 {
    self.balances.read(account)
}
```

The balance of a given address can be updated using the following function:

```rust
// update balance
#[external(v0)]
fn write_balance(ref self: ContractState, account: ContractAddress, new_balance: u256){
    self.balances.write(account, new_balance);
}
```

## Summary

In this chapter, we've discussed how to use the `mapping` type and other useful types in Cairo to create and manage key-value pairs in smart contracts. These concepts will help you develop more efficient and organized smart contracts on Starknet.
